# Geometer
A Windows desktop application for drawing 3D images designed with Visual Studio using C++/CLI language.
User input is given in a *txt* file written in a simple programming language designed for this purpose,
together with possible additional macro *txt* files. The output is a BMP image file.
## Features:
- uses ray tracing for precise output,
- introduces its own simple programming language with parser and syntax checker,
- the main input file and macro files are compiled before implementation,
- the program easily locates and points to the user's syntax errors.
## Repository contents:
- folder **Geometer**: C++ source code (cpp and header files),
- file **Geometer.sln**: main Visual Studio solution file,
- file **Geometer.txt**: a short readme presentation of the program,
- folder **Examples**: examples of input txt files, macro files, and output BMP files.

(To view the files, switch to the *master* branch.)
